#problem
//your program so that it not only shows each number as even or odd,
but also counts how many even and odd numbers there are.

#solution

number = int(input("Enter a number : "))

even_sum = 0
odd_sum = 0
for i in range (1, number + 1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        even_sum +=1
        print (f"{i} is an even number")
    else:
        odd_sum +=1
        print (f"{i} is an odd")

print (f"There are {even_sum} even numbers and {odd_sum} odd numbers.")
